## Discription 
###User story:
When I use the bathroom 
Then I can log the location using googlemaps API 
Then I can post a short comment and using the maps pin and  GIPHY API  
When I leave the app the information persits using client side local storage  
And I can view history


Objectives 
- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap (Foundation)
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIs. (Gify and Google Maps)
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals). *the windows that pop up are an info window and part of the google maps api*
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
